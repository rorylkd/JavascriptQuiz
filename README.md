# JavascriptQuiz

This is a (very short) quiz on javascript. When the start button is pressed, the intro section is hidden and a question is loaded using an object in the JS file. The timer is also started. Clicking an answer will show a new question and update the score. Finishing all the questions will hide the question section and show the final section, which consists of an input field that will write the users name to the page with their score.
